## App features

- **Accounts** — multiple accounts with per-account currency, balances, guarded delete,
  and name/currency search that leaves total net worth unchanged. Transaction entry remembers
  the last-used account. Expanded tablet windows
  show live account details and the latest 20 transactions, with account-specific transfer
  amounts, a two-column account picker, selectable notes/references, and selection retained
  across resizing/restoration.
- **Transactions** — add/edit with calculator keypad, transfers (`from/to` account),
  custom numeric engine (`domain/CalculatorEngine.kt`), duplicate detection, anomaly alerts,
  a "Log again" action that reuses transaction details with today's date, and an
  accidental-exit confirmation for unfinished entries in the editor and widget quick-add.
  "Save & add another" keeps the type, account, and category ready for consecutive entries;
  saved templates restore their category, repeated notes can suggest the usual account without
  changing it automatically, and the surfaced amount display and consistent type selection make
  entries easier to review before saving.
  Frequent category chips are available on phones and tablets. Expanded tablet forms show saved templates in quick-pick layouts,
  with current account balances beside the entry controls.
- **History** — search notes, amounts, accounts, categories, and references; combine
  date presets (today, last 7 days, this month, last month) with type/account filters.
  If there are no transactions yet, add the first one directly from the empty state.
  Filter logged parser-imported M-PESA fees and see each charge beside its source transaction
  in a distinct fee label.
  A live summary shows matching income, spending, and net change in separate account-currency
  totals; transfers are counted separately and incomplete records are disclosed.
  Switch the shared account focus directly from History without losing other filters.
  Expanded tablet windows offer a live, scrollable review pane with Previous/Next actions,
  Page Up/Page Down navigation while the pane is focused, and selectable notes/references.
- **M-PESA import** — rule-based parsing for share/paste, including transaction costs. With
  fee logging enabled, charges are recorded separately and linked to the source in History. The optional new-message listener
  is enabled only on the `community` branch; the `play` branch does not request SMS permission.
  The listener is opt-in, sender-filtered, and review-before-save. On supported devices, Gemini Nano may
  offer an on-device fallback for shared messages and receipt totals. Suggestions must be
  reviewed before use. See `GOOGLE_PLAY_SMS_PERMISSION_REVIEW.md` for the release decision.
- **Smart categorization** — 3-tier suggester (history → correction memory → on-device
  TFLite classifier), self-learning retraining from user corrections.
- **Budgets** — search by budget name or category; per-category limits with suggestion engine,
  forecaster, spending velocity alerts, and expanded tablet grids that adapt to portrait and landscape.
- **Savings goals** — targets, linked accounts, feasibility analysis with trade-off suggestions.
- **Recurring** — rules with due/overdue processing plus auto-detected patterns from history.
- **Insights** — trends, forecasts, seasonality, anomalies, frugal streaks, savings capacity,
  cash-flow projection, PDF statement export (multi-currency).
- **Multi-currency** — ISO currency picker, per-account balances and transaction entry,
  daily automatic reference rates from Frankfurter, and net worth converted to the
  selected default currency. Missing conversions are excluded rather than mixed as raw
  amounts.
- **Monthly finance review** — an animated recap of income, spending, top category,
  month-over-month change, and recorded activity, with conversion-date disclosures. An
  optional fifth page can generate an on-device reflection from aggregate totals only, and
  the recap can be shared through Android's system share sheet.
- **Backup/restore** — versioned JSON export/import (`BackupManager`), atomic Room restore.
- **Spreadsheet export** — date-range CSV statements with readable account/category names,
  original currencies, transfer amounts, and references; saved locally and shared through Android.
- **Widgets & shortcuts** — 6 Glance widgets (snapshot, quick actions, balance, monthly
  summary, quick expense/income) + launcher shortcuts + quick-add activity. Quick-add
  widgets use the last-selected account; the expanded Quick Action widget also previews
  and repeats the latest income or expense with its details prefilled.
- **Reminders** — optional weekly finance-review reminders, scheduled locally and disabled
  until the user opts in.
- **System integration** — DND-aware notification gate with queue, bill reminders, biometric
  app lock, adjustable haptic strength, a unified chartreuse brand theme with light/dark + AMOLED modes, a saved Home balance visibility control, changelog screen,
  skippable onboarding tour, one-time widget pin offer, adaptive phone/tablet navigation. Community
  builds check GitHub Releases on launch and daily, download newer compatible APKs, and notify
  when Android is ready to install an update.
- **Feature discovery** — Settings > What's New includes versioned release notes and a
  feature guide covering all major workflows, quick-access tools, and tablet workspaces.
  Its interactive animated tour walks through every guide section and opens transaction
  entry for practice; expanded tablets show the tour's topic list beside the current step.
- **Privacy and release** — local finance storage, automatic Android backup disabled,
  user-initiated export/restore, in-app privacy policy, and a Play manifest without SMS
  listener access. See `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` and `PLAY_STORE_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`.

## Release branches

- The `play` branch builds the Play-safe AAB with `:app:bundleRelease`; it has no
  `RECEIVE_SMS` permission or SMS receiver.
- The `community` branch keeps all app features enabled, including the disclosed, opt-in
  M-PESA listener. Build its GitHub APK with `:app:assembleRelease`; its application ID is
  `com.makemission.makeflow.community`. GitHub updates require a published, signed APK built with
  the same signing key as the installed app; Android asks the user to allow this source and confirm.
- The current Community build is `2.0.20-community` / code 23.
- Keep Play policy restrictions on the `play` branch. Do not submit the Community artifact
  to Google Play.
- SMS Retriever is not used for M-PESA: it only returns messages containing this app's
  verification hash, which a third-party sender such as M-PESA cannot add.

Key entry points: `MakeFlowApp` (DB + logger init), `MainActivity` (share-intent handling),
`ui/navigation/AppNavigationEngine.kt` (root state-driven navigation, no NavController back
stack), `ui/MainScreen.kt` (tab shell + overlay panels).

## Getting started

Requirements: Android Studio (a recent Narwhal+ release for AGP 9.x), JDK 11+,
Android SDK with API 36, and network access for the first Gradle sync.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/makemissionllc/MakeFlow.git
cd MakeFlow
# open in Android Studio and let Gradle sync, then Run > app
```

Command line:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug          # debug APK
./gradlew test                    # unit tests
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest    # instrumented tests (device/emulator)
./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin # quick compile check
```

## ML model workflow

The transaction classifier is trained **offline**, never on a phone from scratch. M-PESA
messages use deterministic local parsing first; the optional Gemini Nano fallback uses
Google's beta ML Kit Prompt API only for foreground shared text when the model is already
available. The SMS itself is not used to train a model, uploaded, or passed to that fallback
from the background SMS receiver. Nano suggestions are checked against the original message
and remain subject to the usual review-before-save flow. Users can also request receipt
amount/merchant suggestions from a selected image and monthly reflections from aggregate
figures; neither feature stores the image or generated text, and both remain optional.

1. Expand the seed data in `train_category_classifier.py` (aim for hundreds of real
   Kenya-market descriptions).
2. Run it: `python3 train_category_classifier.py` — outputs quantized `.tflite`,
   `vocab.json`, `label_set.json`.
3. Copy the outputs into `app/src/main/assets/ml/`.
4. On-device, user corrections accumulate via `CorrectionRepository` and retrain the
   model in batches (min batch 5) — see `core/ml/RetrainableCategoryClassifier.kt`.
